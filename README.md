## What I Build

I architect AI systems that move the needle:

- **70% faster** development cycles through AI-assisted workflows
- **40% cost reduction** via token optimization and smart model selection
- **99.8% accuracy** in document processing and compliance automation
- **336% engagement increase** through intelligent automation

## Architecture Decisions

How I approach complex technical decisions:

- [ADR-001: Multi-Model LLM Selection Strategy](./architecture-decisions/001-multi-model-llm-selection.md)
- [ADR-002: Real-Time vs Batch Processing](./architecture-decisions/002-realtime-vs-batch-processing.md)
- [ADR-003: Token Cost Optimization Patterns](./architecture-decisions/003-token-cost-optimization.md)

## Technical Expertise

### AI/ML Engineering
- **LLM Orchestration**: GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA, Groq — multi-model with intelligent fallback
- **Multi-Agent Systems**: Task decomposition, autonomous agents, self-correction loops
- **Prompt Engineering**: Context-aware templates, dynamic parameter tuning
- **Cost Optimization**: 40-45% reduction through batching, caching, model selection

### Backend Systems
- **Languages**: Python (FastAPI), TypeScript (Node.js)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, Redis, Supabase, SQLite
- **Architecture**: Event-driven, real-time processing, queue management

### Production Infrastructure
- **Deployment**: Vercel, serverless, edge functions
- **Monitoring**: Performance tracking, error recovery, adaptive rate limiting
- **Scale**: Systems serving 200K+ users with high availability

## Work With Me

I'm currently **open to opportunities** — both consulting engagements and full-time Lead Architect roles.

**What I bring:**
- UK training + Southeast Asia market expertise
- Track record of quantifiable business outcomes
- Production-ready systems, not prototypes

**Get in touch:**
